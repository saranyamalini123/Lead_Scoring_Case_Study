# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study
Problem Statement :

X Education sells online courses to industry professionals.The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos.When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals.

Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not.The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.

Business Goal :

X Education needs help in selecting the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.

The company needs a model wherein you a lead score is assigned to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.

The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

Our Goals of the Case Study:

To build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.

To adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well.
